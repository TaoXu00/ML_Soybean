# ML_Soybean
This project aims to apply machine learning and deep leanring techiniqeus for soybean yields, oil/protein concentration prediction. 
## Directories
- Dataset: It stores all the available datasets, including the original and aggregate dataset from 2012, 2013 and 2014. 
- Plots:  It stores the data analysis plots in Data_statistics and the Machine learning output plots in ML_plots.
- ML_soybean.py is the script for Machine learning. 
- soybeanDataAnalysis.py is to learn the datasets by analyzing some statistical features.
